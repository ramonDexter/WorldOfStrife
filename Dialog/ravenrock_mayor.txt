The road leading to the west will take you to Narfolk, but that's little bit further, like 500 kilometres or so. This area is dangerous, as wild fauna and bandits roam the area. Be careful especially around the old cemetery, not far from village western gate. The eastern road leads to Kolyma. These areas are little bit calmer, but your still need to be careful when travelling in these parts. The roads leads through plateau infected with carnivorous plants.";
