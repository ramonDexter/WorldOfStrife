// This is an example of Quest Pointer
// To make Hellscape Navigator Compass display the quest marker:
//
// 1. Copy this class to your wad/pk3 ZScript code;
// 2. Give the class a unique name, e.g. my_own_hn_QuestPointer_something
//    The name can by anything, but it must contain substring "hn_QuestPointer"
//    to be recognized by Hellscape Navigator.
// 3. Put an object of this class on the map.
//
// Notes:
// - You can create as many QuestPointer classes as you want.
// - QuestPointer detection is dynamic, so if actor moves on the map,
//   the position change is reflected on Compass.
