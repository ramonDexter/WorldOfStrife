Silent Hills Tourist Guide

Welcome tourist to beautiful city of Silent Hills. Our city offers all kinds of services to anyone willing to spend his gold. In Silent Hills you can find services of blacksmiths and techsmiths, grocery market and open market, both located on the eastern bank of river Wesa. The river itself is a landmark, dividing the city into two halves, the eastern one and the western one. The eastern bank is devoted to trading and markets, most of the city shops and traders are located here. The western bank of river is residential, with the City Bath and the TekGuild Outpost.
Peace in our city is guarded by The City Watch, whose officers are vigorously watching over citizens peace throught day and night. The City Watch is sometimes supported by the Binders, who have their base on the western bank of river.
You should also visit the magnificent City Bath located in northwestern corner of city, near the Western Gate. The City Bath are built in classical imperial style, with big swimming pool and other spa services. The pool is found to the left, whereas a colonnade is found to the right, which leads to the men's quarters, which are split into the apodyterium (dressing room), with the frigidarium (for cold baths), which leads to the tepidarium (for medium temperature baths) and then to the calidarium (hot sauna). The heating is guaranteed by a piping system in the walls and double floors that circulate the hot air coming from the furnaces and from mobile braziers. The women's quarters, close to the men's quarters, are split the same way in the apodyterium, tepidarium and calidarium. However, all arew smaller and has no rich decorations as the men's quarters. Women enters through a separate door, on which “Mulier” (woman) is written. Isn't a relaxing bath all what a tired traveller needs?
