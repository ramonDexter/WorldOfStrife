//The keys for the sentences here end in a two-character code, for the object's grammatic gender and number.
//Gender can be one of MFNOX for masculine, feminine, neutral, object, or indeterminate
//Number can be one of SDPX for singular, dual, plural, or indeterminate
//The fall-through for gender is M->X, F->X, N->X, O->X
//The fall-through for number is D->P->X, S->X
//gender is tried before number, so for example if MS is desired, the check sequence will be MS->XS->MX->XX
