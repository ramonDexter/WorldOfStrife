There is this old ruin of watchtower and the old cemetery. Locals say it's haunted, but I don't believe such crap. Maybe there are bandints hiding in one of the tombs, but nothing supernatural. You can believe me, I've visited the plcae at night many times. Then there's this old tower, little bit farther from the village. It's a meeting place for local young lovers. I've also visited tha place ... a many times. And I cannot forget the csave system. Be careful when you go inside, the ceilign is lower there. That's the wester part. Then there's the eastern part.
