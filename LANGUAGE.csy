The eastern bank is devoted to trading and markets, most of the city shops and traders are located here. The western bank of river is residential, with the City Bath and the TekGuild Outpost.\n\n"
											"Peace in our city is guarded by \c[red]The City Watch\c[white], whose officers are vigorously watching over citizens peace throught day and night. The City Watch is sometimes supported by \c[red]The Binders\c[white], who have their base on the western bank of river.\n\n"
											"\c[white]You should also visit the magnificent \c[red]City Bath\c[white] located in northwestern corner of city, near the Western Gate. The City Bath are built in classical imperial style, with big swimming pool and other spa services. The pool is found to the left, whereas a colonnade is found to the right, which leads to the men's quarters, which are split into the apodyterium (dressing room), with the frigidarium (for cold baths), which leads to the tepidarium (for medium temperature baths) and then to the calidarium (hot sauna). The heating is guaranteed by a piping system in the walls and double floors that circulate the hot air coming from the furnaces and from mobile braziers. The women's quarters, close to the men's quarters, are split the same way in the apodyterium, tepidarium and calidarium. However, all arew smaller and has no rich decorations as the men's quarters. Women enters through a separate door, on which “Mulier” (woman) is written. Isn't a relaxing bath all what a tired traveller needs?";

But after about 70 years, the city became independent from the Narfol government and subsequently entered the emerging Bodric Empire. About 70 years ago, the TekGuild established its headquarters here, making the sleepy port city a university city of major importance, which was matched by the subsequent development of the city.

The harsh climate and constant attacks by mutants shaped the Binders into fierce fighters. As their numbers grew, the Binders began to expand their influence.\n"

Among the Binders' main tasks is to protect the inhabitants from mutants that appeared after the comet hit. The bands of mutants made some parts of the continent uninhabitable. As a result, the Binders have their own base in most cities, from which they set out to hunt. The actions of the Binders are known among the common people, who are always happy to help the Binders.\n"

Even so, the Binders have maintained a high level of independence, which is reflected in the Binders' organizational structure.
